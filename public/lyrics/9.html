<h3>THE NAGGING MISSUS</h3>
<div class="author">by Stroke Unit</div>

<p class="ref"><b>Ref.:</b><br/>
You are my own slave, my victim and I shut<br/>
The door of your cage, your freedom I will cut<br/>
No one never in my life will contradict the rules I enact<br/>
And isn’t it amazing I got chains but I don’t react ?</p>

<p>Love and marriage always form a pair<br/>
Love and marriage always belong together<br/>
Like white socks on slip-on shoes<br/>
You cannot seperate an aeroplane from it’s crew<br/>
Frank Sinatra’s elementary rules <br/>
Go together like pupils and teachers in school<br/>
On wedding groom and bride<br/>
A Spanish dancer and his pride</p>

<p>You are my own slave, my victim and I shut<br/>
The door of your cage, your freedom I will cut, yeah.....</p>

<p>Every pair’s producing a new fruit<br/>
The things you say can set me in good or bad mood<br/>
All depends on anything<br/>
On summer, winter, autumn and spring<br/>
Rainbow is the sum of rain and sun<br/>
The natural balance is based on white Yin and black Yang<br/>
Contrasts, manic – depressive<br/>
In just one man they live</p>

<p>Birdflight and wing - murder and sin<br/>
Poor tramps who want to give</p>

<p>Woman and man - Ollie and Stan<br/>
Nice girls don’t want to live</p>

<p class="ref"><b>Ref.</b></p>

<p>Still we search for nothing and everything<br/>
Still don’t know what manic illusions bring<br/>
Still we search for nothing and everything<br/>
Still don’t know the secret lies in ourselves</p>
