<h3>BLOODYMIR</h3>
<div class="author">by Stroke Unit</div>

<p>Everybody, meet the death.........!!!!!</p>

<p>A young Russian boy was our guest<br/>
(full of blood, full of beer)<br/>
Drunken fall and emergency quest<br/>
(could not walk, could not steer)</p>

<p>An unknown Russian boy needed help when he was staggering into our room<br/>
(he played with death)<br/>
Drunken and his head full of blood he tried to stammer any words I could not understand<br/>
(he played with death)</p>

Upside down you're hanging between hell and heaven<br/>
Stairway to your pride<br/>
Living suicide, there’s no perspective of life<br/>
On the other side lies romance to die</p>

<p>Let’s die....!!!!</p>

<p>So, ambulance was coming and then he was running<br/>
far away from any good meant help<br/>
(Don’t play with death)<br/>
The unknown Russian boy lived his life without rhyme and reason and destroyed<br/>
(Don’t play with death)<br/>
  His own life, I can touch but not reach him<br/>
  No one gives him love and peace but they teach him<br/>
(Don’t play with death)<br/>
To stand alone and that sick foreign system shows him how to get stoned<br/>
(Don’t play with death)</p>
