<h3>HALLS OF VALHALLA</h3>
<div class="author">by Stroke Unit</div>

<p class="ref"><b>Ref.:</b><br/>
Once upon a time in a land of Normans, an every night attack,<br/>
They didn’t know where to go, what to do but somehow they were living in a trap<br/>
Fearless man the future is planned, your duty, your noble sacrifice<br/>
And Norman fighters don’t justify, the bearmen have to die<br/>
Forever shut their eyes</p>

<p>Ahmad ibn-Fadlan reach the Norman land today !<br/>
Never seen before<br/>
Beowulf, their leader needs the first exotic man<br/>
Never seen, never seen before</p>

<p class="ref"><b>Ref.</b></p>

<p>Ahmad cannot fight with weapons of a higher weight<br/>
Heavy Norman sword<br/>
Forged a sabre bent and light to handle and to fight<br/>
Honor keeps, honor keeps it’s word</p>

<p>Lo, there do I see my father<br/>
Lo, there do I see<br/>
My mother and my sisters and my brothers<br/>
Lo, there do I see the line of my people<br/>
To the beginning, to the beginning</p>

<p>(Solo)</p>

<p>Lo, they do call to me they bid me take my place<br/>
Among them<br/>
In the HALLS OF VALHALLA where the brave<br/>
May live, may live forever</p>

<p>Lala-lalala - lala-lalala  -  lala-lalalay...........  (The Norman Choir)</p>

<p>Lo, there do I see my father. Lo, there do I see my mother And my sisters and my brothers. Lo, there do I see the line of my people Back to the beginning. Lo, they do call to me. They bid me take my place among them In the HALLS OF VALHALLA Where the brave may live forever!</p>
