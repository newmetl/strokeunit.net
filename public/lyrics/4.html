<h3>VIRUS MANKIND</h3>
<div class="author">by Stroke Unit)</div>

<p>Storms of waste gas we blow into the wind<br/>
Synthetic heat waves burn the world’s skin<br/>
Skies filled with thunder of war aeroplanes<br/>
Big waves of mankind, an infinite rain</p>

<p class="ref"><b>Ref.:</b><br/>
The earth doesn’t cry for us when we’ve gone<br/>
For a new chance the illness is done<br/>
Just a virus is what we’ll have been<br/>
To the universe nothing we mean</p>

<p>No natural enemy except himself<br/>
Digging for secret things under his shell<br/>
Population explosion means planet’s corrosion<br/>
A nightmare emerges on psycho-bionic dreams</p>

<p class="ref"><b>Ref.</b></p>

<p>The nature turns a somersault<br/>
The earth starts to crumble and fall<br/>
The seperated pieces of life<br/>
They’ll recombine</p>

<p>Virus mankind, bad disease, dead desserts, deadly seeds we breed now<br/>
We pay our dues, we pay the truth, we pay for inconsiderate world abuse<br/>
Universal fate means it’s too late<br/>
Where are the gods, nature restarts a new age<br/>
No more we’re a part of earth and that’s it!</p>
