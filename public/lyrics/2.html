<p class="ref"><b>Ref.:</b><br/>
Upside down communication<br/>
Destroyed my liberty<br/>
Confusion and frustration<br/>
Bound white doves which are free</p>


<p>Once she said our live runs a certain way<br/>
But fortune changes night and day<br/>
She made plans for love, couldn’t stand the pain<br/>
Turned the facts and sun and rain<br/>
What she send was not what she meant I only misunderstood<br/>
I thought it’s clear but it’s no good<br/>
No good...</p>

<p class="ref"><b>Ref.</b></p>

<p>Bister Mean’s a lonesome and ugly man<br/>
Walking backwards’ all he can<br/>
Rister Mossi’s search for his own curse<br/>
All he’s trying only hurts<br/>
Jichael Mackson’s skin was black he turned into a white can<br/>
Dancing backwards – childish man<br/>
A man ?</p>

<p>Sometimes the darkness fills the light<br/>
It doesn’t matter – Black or White<br/>
The night is bright we see the sun<br/>
Pray to a God – who’s gone</p>

<p>Bullets we shoot at a certain fixed aim<br/>
Are flying a circle round back to our brain</p>

<p>Oh, KFJ planned to stop a nice war<br/>
Bullets were flying all over his car<br/>
In God  they trust for holy world peace<br/>
Infecting the world with a war disease, with a war disease, with a war disease</p>
